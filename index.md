WorkflowHub provides instructions for [registering](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/registering_workflows/registering-a-workflow/) and [updating](https://about.workflowhub.eu/docs/guide-to-using-workflowhub/#keeping-workflows-up-to-date) workflows. 

Here, we have adapted and expanded on these instructions to support Australian contributors to WorkflowHub, in particular those contributing to the [Australian BioCommons Space on WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/programmes/8/workflows).

{% include callout.html type="note" content="All workflows in the Australian BioCommons WorkflowHub space will automatically appear in the [WorkflowFinder service](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/workflowfinder). A minimum set of metadata is expected for workflows registered in the BioCommons WorkflowHub space. These are described in more [detail here](new_workflow)." %}
