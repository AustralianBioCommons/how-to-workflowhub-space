## Registering a new version of an existing workflow

### Instructions for workflows imported via Git

1. Open the registry entry for your workflow
2. Select the `Actions` dropdown menu (top right)
3. Select `New Version`
4. Confirm the original URL for the Git repository, or add a new URL if the workflow is now in a different repository 
5. Click `Register`
6. Select the specific `Branch` or `Tag` that you would like to import to WorkflowHub 
7. Click `Continue`
8. *If needed*, update the metadata for your workflow
9. Click `Register`


### Instructions for manually uploaded workflows

To create a new workflow version, the current version must be `Frozen`, which prevents any further modification. This is also the case for DOI minting, as this process requires a fixed version for archiving.

1. Open the registry entry for your workflow 
2. Select the `Actions` dropdown menu (top right)
3. Select `Freeze Version`: this locks the existing version of the workflow and prevents further changes 
4. Select the `Actions` dropdown menu again 
5. Select `New Version`
6. You can now choose to `Upload/Import files`, or you can switch to `Import Git Version` for the new version
7. *If needed*, update the required metadata for the new workflow version
8. Click `Register`


## Editing the metadata for your workflow

1. Open the registry entry for your workflow 
2. Select the `Actions` dropdown menu (top right)
3. Select `Edit Workflow`
4. Update the required metadata 
5. Click `Update`
